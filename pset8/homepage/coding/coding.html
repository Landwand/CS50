        <p class="reg-text">
          After working in a tech company for so many years, the question has come up, "What else do you want from your
          work-life?" Management never appealed to me; the very notion
          was appauling. Somehow I chanced into a new-found friend who was a site-reliability engineer and through our
          friendship I slowly unravelled
          a possibility that was before me all along; I want to become a programmer as a trade.

          Sadly, he wasn't supportive of my cause; seeing my other hobbies, he believes that I am artistic and should
          remain as such. Perhaps his gate-keeping
          comes from a good place; to save me from a mediocre life of failure and self-compromise. Yet I disagree; I
          love the puzzle and the challenge both. After years
          of taking calls from customers and feeling helpless in making a "real" difference, I found a tool to do just
          that. No longer will I cower in fear when I see a {} curly
          brace pair, and no longer will I fear Inspect Element on Chrome when I accidentally get into that mode.
