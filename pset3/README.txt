Hey Vibhor (and any reader!)

This is in-progress.  I'm currently working on the second "point" of the assignment, which is to work on f'n 'record_preferences[]'. I have been stuck for quite some time
as it's such a multi-step problem and difficult for me to understand and design at the same time.

Please refer to the assignment write-up/specs at 
https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/psets/3/tideman/

It's a lot of reading, but you can skip right to "Understanding" which is half-down the webpage.
