# WEEK 3: ALGORYTHMS

## Lab 3: "SORT"
"Provided to you are three already-compiled C programs, sort1, sort2, and sort3. 
Each of these programs implements a different sorting algorithm: selection sort, 
bubble sort, or merge sort (though not necessarily in that order!).  Your task is to determine which sorting algorithm is used by each file."
